Giving i3wm a try
------------------

While i really like to handle my tools via keyboard shortcuts, i tend to handle my windows with the mouse or trackpad.

Don't ask me why, but on my Macbook this feels totally natural and does impact my flow, but on the linux box i use at work it's kinda awkward.
Maybe it's the absence of the trackpad and gesture control and the tool Moom[0], i can't tell...

As the number of tools i use on the aforementioned box is quite overseeable, i thought that i could give the i3wm[1] a try.
