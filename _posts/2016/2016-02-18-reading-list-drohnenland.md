In the beginning of the last year I read the book 'Drohnenland'
by Tom Hillenbrand.
The story takes place in a not-so-far future scenario with self-driving cars and
a matrix-like network.
With this technology people are enabled to merely exist and interact in a
datasphere without the necessity of physical presence in that place. The capabilities of this system are undoubted and mostly undisputed.

Also police investigations take place in that datasphere and thus are solved rather quickly with little room for doubts.

The book describes one of the cases that are resolved in this manner, but the investigator is a little 'old-fashined' and started his job before everything became technology-dependent. Soon after he examined the crime scene from within the datasphere, he get's a nagging feeling that it would be nearly impossible to commit a crime in the way the evidences in the sphere tell it...
