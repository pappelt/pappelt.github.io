Recently i had to dig into the Specs of HTML 4.01 and 5.
When you're not used to read such material on a regular basis the initial lecture can be very confusing.

Here are some sites i found at Auntie Google's village store:

* [How to Read W3C Specs - A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/readspec)
* [How to read a specification - AMIQ Consulting](http://www.amiq.com/consulting/2015/04/24/how-to-read-a-specification/)
* [Understanding the CSS Specifications - W3.org](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/read.en.html)
